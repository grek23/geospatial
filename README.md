Learning to work with some geospatial/sat data


This is a really rough script. I had to download a .nc file from NOAA:

https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/cpc_us_precip/

Need to be able to capture this from the web without a local copy.
Then working to understand the organization of this data and build some simple hopefully useful graphs.

Work in progress
